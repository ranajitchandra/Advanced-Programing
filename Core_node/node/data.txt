Load shedding is the intentional interruption of electricity supply to different areas to prevent the entire power system from failing. It usually occurs when the demand for electricity is higher than the available supply. During load shedding, homes, schools, hospitals, and businesses face temporary power cuts, which can disrupt daily activities and productivity. Students struggle to study, shops cannot operate normally, and household chores get delayed. Although load shedding is inconvenient, it helps protect the power grid from major damage. To reduce the need for load shedding, countries must invest in reliable energy sources, improve infrastructure, and encourage people to use electricity wisely.
